WP-Maxheadroom-Theme
====================

This is my first WordPress Theme that I'm using on my private WordPress blog for practicing.

The goal is to have a simple and lightweight layout for a picture/photo heavy blog page.

Feel free to clone and use this Theme for your own purposes. But please don't make money with it. 

Installation
============

Just clone this theme into your _wordpress/wp-content/themes/_ folder:

user@hostname:/srv/www/htdocs/wordpress/wp-content/themes$ git clone https://maxheadroom@github.com/maxheadroom/WP-Maxheadroom-Theme.git WP-Maxheadroom-Theme

Customization
=============

The theme already contains a few customizations. Please have a look into the _.gitignore_ file. Files listed there will not be 
overwritten by a template update (git pull).

You can add your personalized header settings into the _personalized-header.php_ file for instance.
